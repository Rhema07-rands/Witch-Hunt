Citela: Damn, talk about The last supper.
Citela: Meal so good you'd think its our last one together.
Echidna: What?
Citela: Nothing.
Echidna: ...😒
Citela: *Burp* ...I'm going to bed.
Echidna's Thoughts: (Her jokes are always so dark...At least they are kinda funny)
Echidna: Time to do the dishes...
